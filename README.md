We're building a life-changing educational platform where anyone can create a mobile app without coding. You put some data into the spreadsheet, press the button, and your app is ready to launch. We also have started a TV channel where we cover different entrepreneurial topics and inspire people to create projects and to make mobile apps. Our curriculum includes a game based on the real-life data that teaches players how to run a successful global company and take their business to the next level. 

This is how people will educate themselves in the future, instead of spending years in college learning sometimes outdated information for a very expensive price. 

There is a gap between people with ideas and technology. People think they need to have programming skills or get funding to create a prototype. We solve this problem and remove these obstacles. In the future, college education will take days, not years.
