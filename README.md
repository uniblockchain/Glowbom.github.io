# Glowbom

A life-changing educational platform where anyone can create a mobile app without coding. You put some data into the spreadsheet, press the button, and your app is ready to launch. We also have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrYQEQPhAHmn7N8W58nNwOw) where we cover different entrepreneurial topics.

# Text Adventures

The idea of the module comes from [Choose Your Own Adventure Books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure). You'll be able to create your own stories effortless without knowing how to code.

We're currently working hard on [Android](https://github.com/Glowbom/textadventures-android) and [iOS](https://github.com/Glowbom/textadventures-ios) versions. The module will be available via Glowbom Studio. Please stay tuned and subscribe to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrYQEQPhAHmn7N8W58nNwOw).

# Thank you!
